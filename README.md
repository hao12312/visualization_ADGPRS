# visualization_ADGPRS
This repository contains MATLAB codes for visualization and plotting simulation results of Stanford ADGPRS (Automatic-Differentiation-based General Purpose Research Simulator) for reservoir simulation. 
Two examples are provided: 
- Plotting water saturation maps for oil-water flow in a 3D simulation case 50x50x6 (published in "Joint Optimization of Economic Project Life and Well Controls" in SPE Journal: https://doi.org/10.2118/182642-PA)
- Plotting/visualization of water saturation maps for oil-water flow in a 2D simulation case 60x60 (https://doi.org/10.2118/182642-PA)
